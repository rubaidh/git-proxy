= Git Proxy

We use git submodules a lot. This means that, when we clone a shiny new Ruby
on Rails application, typically we have a submodule for Rails itself. And that
means cloning a 10MB repository. It's not the end of the world, but it's a
little bit slow and frustrating. The purpose of this ruby gem is to make it
just that little bit faster.
